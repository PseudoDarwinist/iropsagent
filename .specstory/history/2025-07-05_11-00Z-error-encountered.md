<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting an error when trying to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The error shows "bash: pip: command not found", which means that `pip` is not available in their system PATH or Python is not properly installed.

Since this is a macOS system (darwin 24.5.0), I should help them resolve this issue. There are several possible solutions:

1. They might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`
2. They might need to install Python first
3. They might need to use `python -m pip` instead of `pip`
4. They might need to use a virtual environment

Let me first check what's in the requirements.txt file to understand what dependencies they need, and then provide solutions for the pip issue.</details></think>

---

I can see you're getting a "pip: command not found" error when trying to install the requirements. This is a common issue on macOS. Let me help you resolve this.

First, let me check what's in your requirements.txt file:

---

Read file: requirements.txt

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the requirements. The issue is that `pip` is not found on their system. On macOS, this commonly happens when:

1. Python is not installed
2. Python is installed but pip is not in the PATH
3. They need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`
4. They need to use `python -m pip` instead of `pip`

Let me provide a solution that will help them install the dependencies properly. I'll suggest several approaches, starting with the most common solutions.</details></think>

---

Now I can see your requirements. The "pip: command not found" error is common on macOS. Let me help you fix this and install the dependencies. Here are several solutions to try:

---

```bash
python3 --version
```

```
Chetans-MacBook-Pro:IROPS_Agent chetansingh$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.1
Chetans-MacBook-Pro:IROPS_Agent chetansingh$
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Python 3 is installed (version 3.12.1). Now let me try different approaches to install the packages:

1. Try `pip3` instead of `pip`
2. Try `python3 -m pip` instead of `pip`
3. Check if pip is installed at all

Let me try these in order.</details></think>

---

Great! Python 3.12.1 is installed. Now let's try the correct way to install the packages. On macOS, you typically need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:

---

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The packages have been successfully installed using `pip3`. There was one dependency conflict warning (with python-multipart), but that's just a warning and shouldn't prevent the application from running. The core packages for the flight agent app are now installed.

The user now has:
- `langchain` 
- `python-dotenv` 
- `requests` 
- `amadeus` 
- `google-generativeai` 
- `google-adk` 
- `litellm` 

All the required packages are installed. The user should now be able to run their flight agent app. The error has been resolved - the issue was that they needed to use `pip3` instead of `pip` on macOS.

I should let them know that the dependencies are now installed and they can proceed with running their application.</details></think>

Perfect! The dependencies have been successfully installed. The error was that you needed to use `pip3` instead of `pip` on macOS.

**Summary of what was installed:**
- `langchain` - For the AI agent framework
- `python-dotenv` - For environment variable management  
- `requests` - For HTTP requests to FlightAware API
- `amadeus` - For Amadeus API integration
- `google-generativeai` - For Google AI integration
- `google-adk` - For Google Agent Development Kit
- `litellm` - For LLM integration

There was one dependency conflict warning about `python-multipart`, but this shouldn't affect your flight agent application.

**Next steps:**
1. Make sure you have a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY=your_flightaware_key
   AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=your_amadeus_client_id
   AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_amadeus_client_secret
   API_URL=your_custom_llm_endpoint
   MODEL_NAME=your_model_name
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

2. Run your application:
   ```bash
   python3 flight_agent_app.py
   ```

The installation is now complete and your flight agent application should be ready to run! [[memory:2293273]]
