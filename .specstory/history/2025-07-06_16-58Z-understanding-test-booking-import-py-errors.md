# Understanding test_booking_import.py errors (2025-07-06 16:58Z)

_**User**_

Lets just and tell me waht test_booking_import.py does and why is it erroring out. No fix. Just chat.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to analyze the test_booking_import.py file and explain what it does and why it's erroring out. They specifically said "No fix. Just chat." so I should not provide any code fixes, just analyze and explain.

Let me look at the test file and the error:

1. The test file has 4 tests:
   - Test 1: Database Setup - Creates a user and verifies database is working
   - Test 2: Manual Booking Creation - Manually creates a booking
   - Test 3: Email Import - Imports bookings from email (optional)
   - Test 4: View All Bookings - Shows all bookings in database

2. The error is occurring in Test 2 (Manual Booking Creation) at line 47 where it calls `create_booking(user.user_id, test_booking)`.

3. The error is a JSON serialization error: "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable"

Looking at the stack trace, the error occurs when SQLAlchemy tries to serialize the booking data to JSON. The error happens in the `raw_data` field which appears to be a JSON field that's trying to store the entire test_booking dictionary, which includes a datetime object.

The issue is that the test_booking dictionary contains a datetime object (`departure_date: datetime.now() + timedelta(days=3)`) and when this gets stored in the `raw_data` JSON field, Python's JSON serializer can't handle datetime objects.

I should explain this clearly to the user without providing any fixes.</details></think>

Looking at your `test_booking_import.py` file, it's a test suite for your travel disruption booking system with 4 main tests:

## What the test does:

1. **Test 1 - Database Setup**: Creates a test user (`test@example.com`) and verifies the database connection is working by creating and retrieving the user.

2. **Test 2 - Manual Booking Creation**: Creates a test flight booking manually with sample data (United flight UA1542 from ORD to SFO).

3. **Test 3 - Email Import**: Optionally tests importing bookings from Gmail using app passwords.

4. **Test 4 - View Bookings**: Displays all upcoming bookings in the database.

## Why it's erroring:

The error occurs during **Test 2** when trying to create the manual booking. The issue is a **JSON serialization error**:

```
TypeError: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable
```

Here's what's happening:

1. Your test creates a `test_booking` dictionary with a `departure_date` field containing a `datetime` object:
   ```python
   'departure_date': datetime.now() + timedelta(days=3)
   ```

2. When `create_booking()` tries to save this to the database, it appears to store the entire booking dictionary in a `raw_data` field that's defined as JSON in your database schema.

3. Python's built-in JSON serializer can't handle `datetime` objects directly - it only knows how to serialize basic types like strings, numbers, lists, and dictionaries.

4. SQLAlchemy is trying to JSON-serialize the `raw_data` field before storing it, but chokes on the datetime object.

The test successfully completed the database setup (Test 1) - you can see it created a user and retrieved it fine. The problem is specifically with how datetime objects are being handled when storing booking data as JSON in your database model.
