<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to fix a specific code error that they've shown in the manually added selection. The error is:

```
NameError: name 'load_dotenv' is not defined
```

This is happening in the file `/Users/chetansingh/Documents/Agents/IROPS_Agent/flight_agent/agents/coordinator.py` at line 9 where `load_dotenv(override=True)` is called.

The issue is that `load_dotenv` is not imported. Looking at the requirements.txt file, I can see that `python-dotenv` is listed as a dependency, so the package is available, but the import statement is missing.

I need to:
1. Look at the coordinator.py file to see the current imports
2. Add the missing import for `load_dotenv` from `dotenv`

Let me first read the coordinator.py file to understand the current state.</details></think>

I can see the error - `load_dotenv` is not imported in the coordinator.py file. Let me check the current imports and add the missing import.

Read file: flight_agent/agents/coordinator.py

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue clearly now. The coordinator.py file is calling `load_dotenv(override=True)` on line 9, but there are missing imports:

1. `load_dotenv` needs to be imported from `dotenv`
2. `os` needs to be imported as well since it's used on lines 13-14

I need to add these imports at the top of the file.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue. The file is missing the imports for `load_dotenv` and `os`. Let me add them:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've added the missing imports:
- `import os` for the `os.environ` usage
- `from dotenv import load_dotenv` for the `load_dotenv()` function call

The error should now be fixed. The user specifically asked me to "just fix this code and don't do anything else," so I'll stop here after confirming the fix is complete.</details></think>

---

Fixed! I added the missing imports at the top of the coordinator.py file:
- `import os` 
- `from dotenv import load_dotenv`

The `NameError: name 'load_dotenv' is not defined` should now be resolved.
