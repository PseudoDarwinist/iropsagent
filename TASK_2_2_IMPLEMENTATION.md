## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 2.2: "Create disruption risk detection algorithm" for the IROPS Agent project. The implementation provides comprehensive flight disruption risk assessment with:

- **Delay probability calculation with >30% threshold logic**
- **Weather impact correlation system**
- **Connection risk assessment for missed connections**
- **Compliance with REQ-1.2 and REQ-1.5**

## Key Components

### 1. Core Risk Detection Service
**File**: `flight_agent/services/disruption_risk_detector.py`

The main service implementing the risk detection algorithm with:

#### DisruptionRiskDetector Class
- **30% threshold implementation** for risk level determination
- **Multi-factor risk analysis** using weighted probability calculation
- **Real-time risk assessment** for individual bookings
- **Comprehensive error handling** with fallback assessments

#### Risk Factors Analyzed
1. **Delay Probability** (25% weight)
   - Historical airline/route performance
   - Time of day factors (peak hours = higher risk)
   - Day of week patterns
   - Current flight status integration

2. **Weather Impact** (30% weight) - *Highest weighted factor*
   - Real-time weather data correlation
   - Airport-specific weather pattern analysis
   - Seasonal weather risk factors
   - Visibility, wind, and precipitation impact scoring

3. **Connection Risk** (5% weight)
   - Automatic detection of connecting flights
   - Minimum connection time analysis
   - Airline change penalties
   - Tight connection risk assessment

4. **Historical Patterns** (15% weight)
   - Airline reliability scoring
   - Route performance analysis
   - Seasonal disruption factors

5. **Airport Congestion** (15% weight)
   - Airport-specific congestion scoring
   - Peak hour multipliers
   - Real-time congestion correlation

### 2. Risk Assessment Data Structures

#### RiskLevel Enum
```python
LOW = "low"           # < 30% probability
MEDIUM = "medium"     # 30-50% probability (exceeds threshold)
HIGH = "high"         # 50-70% probability
CRITICAL = "critical" # > 70% probability
```

#### DisruptionRisk Dataclass
Complete risk assessment containing:
- Overall probability (0.0 to 1.0)
- Risk level classification
- Individual risk factor breakdown
- Weather correlation data
- Connection risk analysis
- Actionable recommendations
- Confidence scoring

### 3. Integration Tools
**File**: `flight_agent/tools/risk_monitoring_tools.py`

Risk-aware monitoring tools that integrate with existing flight monitoring system:

#### Key Functions
- `monitor_flights_with_risk_assessment()` - Enhanced monitoring with risk analysis
- `analyze_connection_risks(user_email)` - User-specific connection analysis
- `weather_disruption_forecast()` - Weather-based disruption forecasting
- `generate_risk_summary_report()` - System-wide risk reporting

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `tests/flight_agent/test_disruption_risk_detector.py`

Complete test coverage including:
- Unit tests for all risk factors
- Integration tests with database
- Requirement compliance verification
- Performance requirement validation
- Error handling scenarios

## Implementation Details

### 30% Threshold Logic (REQ-1.2)

The system implements a strict 30% disruption probability threshold:

```python
def _determine_risk_level(self, probability: float) -> RiskLevel:
    if probability >= 0.7:
        return RiskLevel.CRITICAL
    elif probability >= 0.5:
        return RiskLevel.HIGH
    elif probability >= 0.3:  # 30% threshold
        return RiskLevel.MEDIUM
    else:
        return RiskLevel.LOW
```

**Threshold Enforcement**:
- Probabilities â‰¥ 30% trigger MEDIUM or higher risk levels
- Automatic alerts generated when threshold is exceeded
- Recommendations include specific threshold breach warnings

### Weather Impact Correlation

Advanced weather correlation system:

1. **Real-time Weather Integration**
   - Departure and arrival airport weather analysis
   - Airport-specific weather risk patterns
   - Seasonal weather factor integration

2. **Weather Risk Scoring**
   ```python
   def _calculate_weather_risk_score(self, weather_data):
       visibility_risk = max((3 - visibility) / 3, 0) if visibility < 3 else 0
       wind_risk = max((wind_speed - 25) / 20, 0) if wind_speed > 25 else 0
       precipitation_risk = min(precipitation / 0.5, 1) if precipitation > 0 else 0
       return min(visibility_risk + wind_risk + precipitation_risk, 1.0)
   ```

3. **Airport-Specific Patterns**
   - Weather-prone airports (ORD, BOS, LGA) have higher base risk
   - Historical weather impact correlation
   - Seasonal adjustment factors

### Connection Risk Assessment

Sophisticated connection analysis:

1. **Automatic Connection Detection**
   - Scans user's bookings for potential connections
   - Identifies flights departing from previous destination
   - Time window analysis (within 12 hours)

2. **Risk Calculation Logic**
   ```python
   if layover_minutes <= min_connection_time:
       risk = 0.9  # Very high risk
   elif layover_minutes <= min_connection_time * 1.5:
       risk = 0.6  # High risk
   elif layover_minutes <= min_connection_time * 2:
       risk = 0.3  # Medium risk
   else:
       risk = 0.1  # Low risk
   ```

3. **Minimum Connection Time Database**
   - Airport-specific minimum connection times
   - Airline change penalties (additional 30 minutes)
   - International flight considerations

### REQ-1.5 Compliance: Comprehensive Analysis

The system satisfies REQ-1.5 through:

1. **Multi-Factor Analysis**: 5+ risk factors analyzed simultaneously
2. **Weather Correlation**: Dedicated weather impact assessment
3. **Connection Analysis**: Automated connection risk detection
4. **Historical Integration**: Airline and route performance correlation
5. **Real-time Updates**: Integration with current flight status
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment of risk calculations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Assessment
```python
from flight_agent.services.disruption_risk_detector import detect_disruption_risk

risk = await detect_disruption_risk("booking_123")
if risk.overall_probability > 0.3:  # 30% threshold
    print(f"HIGH RISK: {risk.overall_probability:.1%}")
    for rec in risk.recommendations:
        print(f"- {rec}")
```

### Integration with Monitoring
```python
from flight_agent.tools.risk_monitoring_tools import monitor_flights_with_risk_assessment

report = monitor_flights_with_risk_assessment()
print(report)  # Shows risk analysis for all upcoming flights
```

### Connection Analysis
```python
from flight_agent.tools.risk_monitoring_tools import analyze_connection_risks

analysis = analyze_connection_risks("user@example.com")
print(analysis)  # Shows connection risks for user's bookings
```

## Performance Characteristics
