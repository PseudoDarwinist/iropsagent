# Requirements Specification - IROPS Agent

## Project Overview

The IROPS (Irregular Operations) Agent is an AI-powered flight disruption management system built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). The system automatically monitors flight bookings, detects disruptions, and coordinates rebooking options for affected passengers.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Flight Booking Management
- **FR1.1**: Import flight bookings from email sources
- **FR1.2**: Manual booking entry capability
- **FR1.3**: Store booking details (PNR, flight number, dates, passenger info)
- **FR1.4**: Support multiple airlines and booking classes
- **FR1.5**: Maintain booking status (CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)

### FR2: Flight Monitoring
- **FR2.1**: Real-time flight status monitoring using FlightAware API
- **FR2.2**: Detect disruptions (cancellations, delays >2 hours, diversions)
- **FR2.3**: Monitor all active bookings for a user
- **FR2.4**: Track disruption events with timestamps
- **FR2.5**: Provide disruption severity assessment

### FR3: Automated Rebooking
- **FR3.1**: Search for alternative flights when disruptions occur
- **FR3.2**: Use Amadeus API for comprehensive flight search
- **FR3.3**: Present rebooking options to passengers
- **FR3.4**: Process rebooking selections
- **FR3.5**: Update booking status after rebooking

### FR4: User Management
- **FR4.1**: User registration and profile management
- **FR4.2**: Store passenger preferences (seat, airline, class)
- **FR4.3**: Email connection management for booking import
- **FR4.4**: Multiple booking associations per user

### FR5: Agent Coordination
- **FR5.1**: Master coordinator agent to orchestrate sub-agents
- **FR5.2**: Specialized sub-agents for distinct functions:
  - Booking import agent
  - Disruption monitor agent
  - Rebooking specialist agent
- **FR5.3**: Intelligent task delegation between agents
- **FR5.4**: Context preservation across agent interactions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance

- **NFR1.3**: Real-time disruption detection and notification

### NFR2: Reliability
- **NFR2.1**: 99.5% uptime for monitoring services
- **NFR2.2**: Fault tolerance for API failures
- **NFR2.3**: Data persistence and recovery capabilities

### NFR3: Security
- **NFR3.1**: Secure API key management (no hardcoded keys)
- **NFR3.2**: Encrypted storage of sensitive booking data
- **NFR3.3**: OAuth integration for email access
- **NFR3.4**: User data privacy compliance

### NFR4: Scalability
- **NFR4.1**: Horizontal scaling for increased user load
- **NFR4.2**: Efficient database queries for large datasets
- **NFR4.3**: API rate limit management

### NFR5: Usability
- **NFR5.1**: Natural language interaction with AI agents
- **NFR5.2**: Clear disruption notifications
- **NFR5.3**: Intuitive rebooking option presentation

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Integration APIs
- **TR1.1**: FlightAware AeroAPI for real-time flight data
- **TR1.2**: Amadeus Travel API for alternative flight search
- **TR1.3**: Email provider APIs (Gmail, Outlook) for booking import
- **TR1.4**: Google ADK framework compliance

### TR2: Data Storage
- **TR2.1**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL support
- **TR2.2**: JSON storage for flexible booking data
- **TR2.3**: Database migration capability
- **TR2.4**: Backup and recovery procedures

### TR3: Architecture
- **TR3.1**: Multi-agent architecture using ADK
- **TR3.2**: Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- **TR3.3**: Modular tool-based design
- **TR3.4**: Session management for conversational state

## Constraints

### C1: External Dependencies
- Google ADK framework availability
- Third-party API rate limits and costs
- API key availability for FlightAware and Amadeus

### C2: Technical Limitations
- Python 3.8+ runtime requirement
- ADK version 1.0.0+ compatibility
- SQLAlchemy ORM constraints

### C3: Business Constraints
- Real-time data availability from airlines
- Booking modification permissions
- Passenger consent for automated actions

## Acceptance Criteria
